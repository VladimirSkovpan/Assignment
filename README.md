Unfortunately the solution is partialy completed due to lack of time.
The solution has a BFS function which is calculating the Shortest Possible Route in a matrix mat from source cell (i, j) to destination cell (x, y).
The next steps for the solution implementation will be:
1) To get a list of all ghost coordinates from the matrix.
2) For each ghost coordinate calculate the Shortest Possible Route.
