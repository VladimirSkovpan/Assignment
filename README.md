The solution is based on BFS function which is calculating the Shortest Possible Route in a matrix mat from source cell (i, j) to destination cell (x, y).
It gets a list of all ghost coordinates from the matrix.
For each ghost coordinate calculates the Shortest Possible Route.
Finally generates a list which has a ghost coordinate and the distance from pacman.
